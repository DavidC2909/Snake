# Snake Game
In this project, I designed and implemented a classic Snake game using Java. Leveraging Java's Graphical User Interface (GUI) capabilities and core Java programming, I created an engaging and interactive gaming experience.

# Project Features:
1. Gameplay: The Snake game features intuitive controls, allowing players to guide the snake around the game board. The objective is to collect apples to grow the snake while avoiding collisions with the game boundaries and itself.
2. Graphics: I utilized Java's GUI to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
3. Scoring: The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases with each apple eaten. A scoring system adds competitiviness and encourages players to strive for higher scores.
